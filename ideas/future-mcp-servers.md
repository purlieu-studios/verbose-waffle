# Future MCP Server Ideas

This document tracks potential MCP servers to build for the cooking game project.

## Custom MCP Servers to Build

### 1. Arch ECS MCP Server ‚≠ê HIGH VALUE!
**Purpose:** Streamline development with Arch ECS in Godot + C#

**Why Build This:**
- No existing ECS MCP servers exist
- Godot MCP plugins only support GDScript
- Would benefit entire Arch ECS + Godot community
- Great open-source portfolio piece
- Solves OUR immediate development needs

**Potential Tools:**
- `create_component(name: str, fields: dict)` - Generate component structs
- `create_system(name: str, query: list[str])` - Generate system boilerplate
- `create_entity_archetype(name: str, components: list[str])` - Generate common entity types
- `find_entities_with_components(components: list[str])` - Search codebase for entities
- `analyze_query_performance(system_name: str)` - Performance optimization suggestions
- `list_all_components()` - Inventory all components in project
- `list_all_systems()` - Inventory all systems
- `validate_component_usage(component_name: str)` - Find unused components
- `generate_component_documentation()` - Auto-document ECS architecture
- `suggest_system_ordering()` - Recommend system execution order

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use FastMCP (like our code-search server)
- Parse C# files to understand component/system structure
- Use Roslyn (C# compiler API) for robust C# parsing
- Integration with code-search for intelligent suggestions

**Benefits:**
- Rapid ECS development ("create a Health component with Max and Current fields")
- Architecture validation and optimization
- Documentation generation
- Community contribution opportunity

**Timeline:** Build after ECS architecture is established in game (Month 2-3?)

### 2. Game Data Server
**Purpose:** Manage recipes, ingredients, and game balancing

**Potential Tools:**
- `get_recipe(recipe_name: str)` - Fetch recipe configurations
- `list_all_recipes()` - Get all available recipes
- `validate_ingredient_combo(ingredients: list[str])` - Check if ingredients work together
- `calculate_recipe_score(ingredients: list[str], cooking_method: str)` - Score a player's dish
- `suggest_ingredient_prices()` - AI-powered economic balancing
- `analyze_recipe_difficulty(recipe_id: str)` - Difficulty analysis
- `get_flavor_profile(ingredients: list[str])` - Determine flavor combinations

**Data Sources:**
- JSON/YAML recipe database
- Ingredient properties database
- Game balance configuration files

**Benefits:**
- Claude can help balance recipes without manual file editing
- Quick recipe lookups during development
- AI-powered suggestions for new content
- Validate game economy

### 2. Godot Scene Inspector
**Purpose:** Parse and analyze Godot `.tscn` and `.gd` files

**Potential Tools:**
- `get_scene_structure(scene_path: str)` - Parse scene hierarchy
- `find_node(scene_path: str, node_name: str)` - Locate specific nodes
- `list_scene_scripts(scene_path: str)` - Get all attached scripts
- `find_unused_scenes()` - Identify orphaned scene files
- `validate_scene_references()` - Check for broken references
- `get_node_properties(scene_path: str, node_path: str)` - Extract node configuration
- `find_scenes_using_script(script_path: str)` - Reverse lookup

**Benefits:**
- Understand complex scene hierarchies
- Find and fix broken references
- Refactor scenes with AI assistance
- Documentation generation
- Asset cleanup

## Implementation Priority

### Already Implemented
1. ‚úÖ **Code Search** - Working perfectly!

### High Priority (Next Steps)
2. üéÆ **GDAI MCP Plugin** - Install ASAP! This will revolutionize Godot development
   - Claude can create scenes, fix errors, run tests
   - Eliminates context switching between editor and Claude
   - NOTE: GDScript only - won't understand our C# Arch ECS code

3. üèóÔ∏è **Arch ECS MCP Server** (Custom) - Build once ECS architecture is established
   - Fill the gap left by GDScript-only Godot MCP
   - Community contribution opportunity
   - High impact for our C# workflow

4. üç≥ **Game Data Server** (Custom) - Build when recipe system is designed
   - Recipe management
   - Ingredient balancing
   - AI-powered game design assistance

### Medium Priority (When Needed)
5. üóÑÔ∏è **Database MCP** - When ASP.NET backend starts
   - Consider PostgreSQL or SQLite
   - Or use mcp-dbs for multi-database support

6. üåê **Firecrawl MCP** - For content research
   - Scrape real recipes for inspiration
   - Research cooking techniques

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
7. üé≠ **Playwright** - Web app testing automation
8. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Supabase/Cloudflare** - When deploying to production
9. üé§ **MiniMax MCP** - If adding voice acting to NPCs

### Maybe Someday
- Anki MCP for player tutorial system
- E2B for community-submitted recipe testing
