<details>
<summary>üìã PR Template Meta</summary>

**Why this template is so detailed:**

This template enforces good practices by making you think through:
1. **Why** the change is needed (not just what changed)
2. **Testing** - did you actually verify it works?
3. **Code quality** - does it meet our standards?
4. **Security** - are there vulnerabilities?
5. **Documentation** - can others understand/use this?
6. **Breaking changes** - will this break existing code?

**You don't need to fill out every section** - only what's relevant to your PR. Delete sections that don't apply.

**If you're tempted to skip sections:** Ask yourself if you're rushing and might introduce bugs.
