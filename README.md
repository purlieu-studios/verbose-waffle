## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.0+
- Godot Engine 4.x
- Python 3.10+ (for code-search tool)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purlieu-studios/verbose-waffle.git
   cd cooking-project
   ```

2. Set up the code-search tool (optional but recommended):
   - Windows: `.\tools\code-search\setup_rag.bat`
   - macOS/Linux: `./tools/code-search/setup_rag.sh`

3. Open the Godot project:
   - Navigate to `apps/game/`
   - Open `project.godot` in Godot Engine

4. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build CookingProject.sln
   ```

## Development

This is a monorepo containing multiple projects that work together:

- **Game** (Godot): The main game client (`apps/game/`)
  - Godot-specific code and scene scripts
- **Game Logic** (C# Library): Shared game logic (`packages/game-logic/`)
  - Core game systems, ECS components, recipe logic
  - Strict code quality enforcement (analyzers, tests required)
  - Shared between game client and web backend
- **Web** (ASP.NET): Backend services, APIs, player accounts (`apps/web/`)
  - REST APIs, authentication, leaderboards
  - Strict code quality enforcement

**Where to put code:**
- Godot-specific UI/scene code â†’ `apps/game/`
- Shared game logic (ECS, recipes, etc.) â†’ `packages/game-logic/`
- Backend/API code â†’ `apps/web/`

### Quality Standards

We enforce strict quality standards to ensure maintainable, bug-free code:

#### ðŸ”’ Enforced by Git Hooks
- **Small commits:** â‰¤300 LOC per commit
- **Protected configs:** Code quality rules can't be weakened accidentally

#### ðŸ¤– Enforced by CI
- **Test coverage:** 90%+ required on all code
- **All tests pass:** No failing tests allowed
- **Code analysis:** Warnings treated as errors
- **PR size:** â‰¤1000 LOC recommended per PR

#### ðŸ“‹ Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Make small, focused commits (<300 LOC each)
3. Write tests (maintain 90%+ coverage)
4. Create pull request
5. CI validates everything automatically
6. Review and merge when green

**See [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) for complete details.**

### Quick Start for Contributors

```bash
# Enable git hooks
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make small commits with tests
git commit -m "Add HealthComponent"  # <300 LOC
git commit -m "Add tests for HealthComponent"  # <300 LOC

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/your-feature
gh pr create

# CI will validate:
# âœ… Commit sizes
# âœ… Test coverage (90%+)
# âœ… All tests pass
# âœ… Code quality rules
```

## Contributing

**Before contributing, read:**
1. [Development Workflow](docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) - Required reading
2. [Code Quality Rules](docs/CODE_QUALITY_RULES.md) - Why the rules exist

**TL;DR:**
- Small commits (<300 LOC)
- Always include tests (90%+ coverage)
- All PRs must pass CI
- One logical change per commit
