# Cooking Game - Overview

## Game Concept

A fast-paced cooking game where players must prepare dishes under time pressure while managing tool maintenance (knife sharpness, stove temperature) and ingredient preparation.

## Core Loop

1. **Receive Order** - Customer orders a dish
2. **Gather Ingredients** - Select required ingredients
3. **Prepare Ingredients** - Chop, slice, press as needed
4. **Cook** - Apply heat, manage temperature
5. **Serve** - Complete dish, earn score
6. **Repeat** - Handle multiple orders simultaneously

## Key Mechanics

- **Tool Degradation**: Knives dull with use, must be sharpened
- **Temperature Management**: Each dish has optimal cooking temp
- **Time Pressure**: Orders have deadlines, late = reduced score
- **Multi-tasking**: Handle multiple dishes simultaneously

## Win Condition

Complete service shift with high enough customer satisfaction score.

## Lose Condition

Customer satisfaction drops below threshold due to:
- Too many late/burned orders
- Serving incorrect dishes
- Taking too long

## Progression

- Unlock new recipes
- Unlock new tools (better knives, multiple stoves)
- Unlock upgrades (faster sharpening, better temperature control)
- Harder shifts (more orders, tighter deadlines)

## Target Experience

Players should feel:
- **Rewarded** for good planning and multitasking
- **Challenged** by time management and tool maintenance
- **Satisfied** when completing a rush successfully
- **Motivated** to improve technique and unlock content
